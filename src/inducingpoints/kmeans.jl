  KMeansIP(X::AbstractMatrix, m; obsdim = 1, nMarkov = 10, weights = nothing, tol = 1e-3)

k-Means [1] initialization on the data `X` taking `m` inducing points.
The seeding is computed via [2], `nMarkov` gives the number of MCMC steps for the seeding.
Additionally `weights` can be attributed to each data point
