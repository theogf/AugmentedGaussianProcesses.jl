# Julia GP Package Comparison

## JuliaGaussianProcesses Organization

There is a common effort to bring the GP people together through the JuliaGP organization.
We work on making the building blocks necessary for GP such as [KernelFunctions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/KernelFunctions.jl) for kernels, [AbstractGPs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/AbstractGPs.jl) for the basic GP definitions and more is coming.
The long-term goal is to have AGP.jl depend on all of this elements and to use it as a wrapper.

## ðŸš§ This comparison is now quite outdated and new solutions have been introduced ðŸš§ 
## AugmentedGaussianProcesses.jl vs [Stheno.jl](https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl) vs [GaussianProcesses.jl](https://github.com/STOR-i/GaussianProcesses.jl)

There are already two other Gaussian Process packages in Julia, however their feature are quite orthogonal. They are roughly compared here:
AGP.jl stands for AugmentedGaussianProcesses.jl and GP.jl for GaussianProcesses.jl

Note that the kernels will be defered to `MLKernels.jl` in the future.
